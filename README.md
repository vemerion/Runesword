# Runesword

This is the source code to my minecraft mod **Runesword**, which adds a new type of item
to the game, called runes, which can be dropped by mobs and found in treasure chests.
These runes can be applied to swords and axes, via the use of a new crafting station called the
runeforge. These runes grants the sword/axe bonuses, such as extra damage underwater,
or giving the player a speed boost on kill.
